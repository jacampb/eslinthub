Purpose:

Scan GitHub for public repositories containing JavaScript, pull them down and run them through ESLint. Store results in MySQL database. 

The resulting list of issues will provide a good view of which projects I can contribute to by resolving these issues.

Potentially helping the GitHub community maintain strong(er) coding practices and quality products.


Stack:
Scripting: Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)
